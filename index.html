    <p> Founded in early 2021, North Fork Crossing has quickly made their presence known all around Montana. Most notably in the beautiful Gallatin Valley where they live. In a little over a year they have been able to grow their audience to a wide range of listeners - consisting of traditional bluegrass lovers to die hard jam band enthusiasts.

        Composed of 4 young multi-instrumentalists, North Fork Crossing can do it all. Their genre resides somewhere in a strange untapped musical realm between Traditional Bluegrass, Psychedelic Rock, Americana, and Folk. The quartet - Cade Slayden (guitar), Ryan Kelly (mandolin), Rabi Phelan (upright bass), and Silas Rea (fiddle) are drawn to having Bluegrass reach a new younger generation of people, priding themselves on their unique sound being the “evolution of string band music”
        
        North Fork Crossing has just recently finished writing an album - which they will be recording in early 2023, and look forward to releasing into the world. In the meantime, they have no shortage of shows for you to enjoy all around the state. So whether you’re a Traditional Bluegrass fanatic, or a Psychedelic Rock aficionado, North Fork Crossing blends it all (with something a little extra) for a fast paced, high energy show that all music lovers will enjoy!
